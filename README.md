| Folder | Topic | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **L1 â€“ Stacks â€“ StaticStack** | Static Stack | Array-based stack implementation with push/pop operations and overflow handling. |
| **L2 â€“ Stacks â€“ DynamicStack** | Dynamic Stack | Pointer-based stack supporting dynamic memory allocation. |
| **L3 â€“ Stacks â€“ Advanced Operations** | Advanced Stack Manipulation | Complex stack operations such as segment replacement, merging, and inversion. |
| **L4 â€“ Queue â€“ CircularQueue** | Circular Queue | Queue implementation using circular indexing for efficient memory usage. |
| **L5 â€“ Queue â€“ DynamicQueue** | Dynamic Queue | Linked-list-based queue with enqueue/dequeue operations. |
| **L6 â€“ LinkedList â€“ SinglyLinkedList** | Singly Linked List (Basic) | Core list operations: insertion, deletion, and traversal. |
| **L7 â€“ LinkedList â€“ SinglyLinkedList_Advanced** | Singly Linked List (Advanced) | Specialized list problems: sorting, counting, merging, and interval operations. |

## ðŸš€ Purpose
This repository documents my learning path in **Data Structures and Algorithmic Thinking**, demonstrating:
- Understanding of **pointer manipulation**
- **Memory management** and dynamic allocation in C++
- Ability to **design, implement, and test** low-level data abstractions
